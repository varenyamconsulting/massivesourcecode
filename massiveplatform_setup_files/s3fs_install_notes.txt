Installation notes for migrating production server to s3fs module

see: https://www.drupal.org/project/s3fs

Note: s3fs_migrate module did not work, so instead this method does a manual copy (step 3) with s3cmd.


1. Create AWS S3 Bucket 

- Create s3fs-public folder - ie: BUCKETNAME/s3fs-public
- Enable 'make public' on folder


2. Remove files greater than 250 characters

- s3fs tables support maximum length 250 chars for uri

cd sites/default/files
find -regextype posix-extended -regex '.{250,}'

- Remove any files from user account
select * from file_managed where uri like '%LONGFILENAME%'; <- find uid of long filename


3. Sync drupal files folder with s3cmd

- Install s3cmd

cd sites/default/files
s3cmd -c ~/.s3cfg sync . s3://BUCKETNAME/s3fs-public/


4. Add to setttings.php

/**
 * AWS s3fs settings:
 */
$conf['awssdk2_access_key'] = "ACCESSKEY";
$conf['awssdk2_secret_key'] = "SECRETKEY";


5. Install s3fs module and library

drush en s3fs

- Note: s3fs_file_proxy needs modifying to correctly catch image styles
Instead, we preserve the banner folders so old emails can still refer to them directly
site/default/files/styles/banner/public/images/events
site/default/files/styles/banner/public/images/chapters 

- Install aws library

mkdir sites/all/libraries/awssdk2
cd sites/all/libraries/awssdk2
wget https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/releases/download/2.7.25/aws.zip
unzip aws.zip

- Configure s3fs

Go to admin/config/media/s3fs

Check Always serve files from S3 via HTTPS
Check Use S3 for public:// files
Set S3 Bucket Name 
Set S3 Region


6. Sync s3 to s3fs_files table

drush s3fs-rc

(Note: don't run copy local public files to s3, as we do this with s3sync)

7. Update branding urls in settings.php

Add aws url to branding elements in settings.php

example:

$conf['tm_branding_assets_base_path'] = 'https://BUCKETNAME.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/site_branding'; // path to site_branding assets 

Also update following:

tm_branding_apple_touch_icon_path
tm_branding_frontpage_image
tm_branding_header_logo
tm_branding_footer_logo
tm_branding_search_page_banner

8. Setup Nginx

# before location /
# s3fs
location ~* ^/(s3fs-css|s3fs-js)/(.*) {
  set $s3_base_path 'BUCKETNAME.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public';
  set $file_path $2;

  resolver 8.8.4.4 8.8.8.8 valid=300s;
  resolver_timeout 10s;

  proxy_set_header Authorization "";
  proxy_pass http://$s3_base_path/$file_path;
}

# add to styles
location ~ (^/s3/files/styles/|^/sites/.*/files/styles/) {
	try_files $uri @rewrite;
}

9. Test

Should be working.

Note: Use the image derivates patch. This seems to prevent the first time 404 when new style is requested.

$conf['tm_image_module_derivatives_patch'] = true; // apply image derivates patch 


10. Set up for cloudfront

Install cloudfront and load from bucket
Use CNAME in s3fs settings

11. Troubleshooting

select count(*) from file_managed where uri like 's3://%'; <- incorrectly migrated
select count(*) from file_managed where uri like 'public://%';
